# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Collaborative Workbench

### The intent of this github is to provide a collaborative environment for shared learning of ML/DL amongst all users.  Users are encouraged to utilize their preferred method of ML (R, python, SPSS, SAS, MATLAB, etc.) and to help others learn and grow in the use of other tools.  While competitions will be a part of this project (primarily through DrivenData.com and Kaggle), placing high in these competitions is not the primary intent of this collaboration.

###  We will proceed through the ML journey in a stagged and progressively more difficult manner as follows:

- Simple classification and regression models
- Neural Networks
- Working with image data
- Working with location data
- Working with sound data
- Working with complex and disparrate data sources
- Whatever lines of effort the path takes us down from here

### Note that I am utilizing this github as a means to push myself deeper into the ML/DL and Data Science / Programmer rabbit hole and am by no means an expert at any of this.  Just hoping to learn a lot in my offtime and have some fun doing it.
